## Hi, I am Raul Silveira 

I'm a passionate developer with a deep interest in back-end technologies and a growing understanding of front-end as well. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and am always eager to learn new tools and techniques that help build efficient and scalable solutions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **back-end projects** involving Node.js, Fastify, Knex, SQLite, and other cutting-edge tools. Iâ€™m also experimenting with **web scraping** and **API development**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects** that focus on **back-end** or **full-stack development**.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raulsilveirati), or reach out through my GitHub.

Feel free to check out my projects and drop a message if youâ€™d like to connect!
